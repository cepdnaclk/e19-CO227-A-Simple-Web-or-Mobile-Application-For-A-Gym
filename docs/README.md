## High Level Architecture
![Highlevel](https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e19-CO227-A-Simple-Web-or-Mobile-Application-For-A-Gym/assets/111074993/0f7b8bbc-449b-4437-8e60-fec0c722454e)

•	Users interact with the Gym App through web browsers or mobile devices (represented as "User Devices").
•	The "Frontend" is responsible for providing a user-friendly interface, collecting user input, and displaying information to users.
•	The "Backend" acts as the brain of the system. It manages the entire application, handles communication between the frontend and other components, and implements core business logic.
•	The "AI Trainer" is an intelligent component that uses OpenCV and Python to provide fitness-related assessments and recommendations. It communicates with the backend to process data and deliver results.
•	The "MySQL Database" stores all essential data, including user profiles, appointments, and weight tracking records. The backend interacts with the database to retrieve and store data.
•	External services, such as "Reminders," integrated to enhance the user experience by sending notifications or reminders to users.

## Data & Control Flow

- User Registration
   1.	A new gym member enters their registration details via the frontend (e.g., name, email).
   2.	The frontend sends this data to the backend as an HTTP POST request.
   3.	The backend validates and processes the registration request.
   4.	User profile data, including the unique identifier, is stored securely in the database.
   5.	Confirmation is sent from the backend to the frontend, notifying the user of successful       registration.

- Appointment Scheduling
   1.	A gym member selects an available time slot and trainer for an appointment.
   2.	The frontend sends a request to the backend, specifying the desired date, time, and           participants.
   3.	The backend checks trainer availability and conflicts in the database.
   4.	If the time slot is available, the backend approves the appointment and records it.
   5.	Both the gym member and trainer receive notifications of the scheduled appointment.

- Weight Tracking
   1.	A gym member logs their weight for a specific date via the frontend.
   2.	The frontend sends a weight entry request to the backend, along with the date.
   3.	The backend processes the request, validating the data and user's identity.
   4.	The weight record is securely stored in the database, including the date.
   5.	The system can use this data to generate simple weight trend graphs for the user

![newflowchart](https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e19-CO227-A-Simple-Web-or-Mobile-Application-For-A-Gym/assets/111074993/ff568440-9dd5-404c-b979-61f4d4160026)

## Storage

- Temporary Data Storage - Local Storage
             •	Temporary data, such as user session information (e.g., logged-in user details), is stored in the frontend (React) or handled through client-                   side technologies like cookies or local storage. This data is short-lived and typically lasts for the duration of a user's session.
- Permanent Data Storage - Database(MySql)
             •	Permanent data, such as user profiles, appointment details, and weight tracking records, is stored in a relational database like MySQL. This is the primary data repository for the application and provides long-term storage and retrieval capabilities. User data, appointment history, and weight tracking records are examples of permanent data stored in the database.

## Control Decisions

- User Registration Control 
              •	Decision Point: Occurs during user registration.
              •	Logic/Algorithm:
                           - Check for valid user data, including email uniqueness.
                           - Validate phone numbers, ensuring they are unique.
                           -	Verify the provided data against predefined criteria.
                           - If data meets criteria, approve registration; otherwise, decline.

- Trainer Availability Control
              •	Decision Point: When trainers mark available time slots.
              •	Logic/Algorithm:
                           -	Trainers set their schedule by specifying available time slots.
                           -	Backend records this data, associating it with the respective trainers.

- Appointment Scheduling Control
               •	Decision Point: When a member requests an appointment.
               •	Logic/Algorithm:
                           -	The system checks trainer availability for the requested time slot.
                           -	It evaluates if there are any conflicts with existing appointments.
                           -	Ensures the appointment capacity is not exceeded.
                           -	If all criteria are met, the appointment is approved; otherwise, it's declined.

- Weight Tracking Control 
               •	Decision Point: When a member logs their weight.
               •	Logic/Algorithm:
                           -	The system validates the weight entry.
                           - It checks if the user is authorized to log weight for the specified date.
                           -	If data is valid and authorized, the weight entry is accepted; otherwise, it's rejected.

- Appointment Approval Process Logic
  ![newflowchart](https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e19-CO227-A-Simple-Web-or-Mobile-Application-For-A-Gym/assets/111074993/bc9fc863-ae79-4672-9a19-ad1a9f062299)

                •	When a member requests an appointment:
                           -	The system checks trainer availability using the trainer's predefined schedule.
                           -	It assesses conflicts with other appointments.
                           -	Ensures the appointment capacity is not exceeded.
                           -	If all checks pass, the appointment is approved; otherwise, it's declined.
